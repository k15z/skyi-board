# Skyi Board
This is my first foray into the world of low-level hell known as C++, so if running this code makes
your laptop melt, explode, or die from a slow and painful memory-leak induced seizure, I apologize
in advance.

The goal to take a source video and project it onto the wall of a target video, making it seem like
the source video is actually playing on the wall. The target video was created by walking around a
set of four paper targets taped to the wall - the source video should be projected onto the targets
so that the perspective transform makes it look consistent regardless of viewing angle.

If this is fast enough for real-time (which is highly unlikely but also the reason I'm trying to do
this in C++), it would make a cool augmented reality playground. Virtual monitors, whiteboards, and
so much more!
